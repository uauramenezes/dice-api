# Dice API
Just a silly API to simulate a dice roll.

## Usage
To use it, make a GET request with the number of sides in the URL. Example:

https://uauramenezes-dice-api.herokuapp.com/d6

Can be used to simulate multiple dices:
* d4: to simulate a dice with 4 sides;
* d6: 6 sides;
* d8: 8 sides;
* d10: 10 sides;
* d12: 12 sides;
* d20: 20 sides;

## About
The objective was to build a simple API using nothing but Node.js, no Express or other framework.
